* @Description: In this project I workedto write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report   
               analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. These are the functions I programmed:


*    main() - The main entry point for your program
*    print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
*    print_array() - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
*    find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
*    find_mean() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
*    find_maximum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
*    find_minimum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
*    sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest. (The zeroth Element should be the argest  
    value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )
